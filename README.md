# Confidant-API

Confidant is an application used as my undergraduate thesis, that works as a social network of support, being a way to connect via chat people who need support with people who are available to help anonymously, reliably, thus making a pleasant experience leaving the user more receptive to seek a professional help in the future.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software.

```
1 - Visual Studio Code or another Source Code Editor.
2 - Node.js
3 - Node Package Manager(npm)
```

### Installing

Firs of all, you need install the Visual Studio Code or another Source Code Editor of your choice. 
I will give you the way to install de Visual Studio Code that can be found on the site, but if you prefer another, can find it in the Google <3!

```
https://code.visualstudio.com/
```

After you must install the Node.js.

Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

```

```

The next step is verify if the Node Package Manager(npm) is installed.

Node Package Manager(npm) makes it easy for JavaScript developers to share and reuse code, and makes it easy to update the code that you’re sharing, so you can build amazing things.

### Check that you have node and npm installed

To check if you have Node.js installed, run this command in your terminal:

```
$ node -v
```

To confirm that you have npm installed you can run this command in your terminal:

```
$ npm -v
```

Lastly you need open the Terminal, go to Project root folder, and run this code:

```
$ npm install
```

Now you have all elements to run this project
